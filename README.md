# openapi-spring

## Concept

This RESTful service is developed using the Spring Framework, providing robust support for creating web applications and services. The main components of this service are:

* **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the configuration and deployment of the application, offering built-in support for application servers. It streamlines the setup process, making it straightforward to get your application up and running.

* **Spring Data JPA**: Utilized for interacting with databases through the Java Persistence API (JPA). It facilitates the creation of repositories for data handling, automating most of the CRUD operations, which simplifies working with the database.

* **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Employed for documenting this RESTful API, providing a convenient interface for testing the API and understanding its specifications. This significantly eases the integration process and the use of the API by other developers and services.
